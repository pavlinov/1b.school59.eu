== ABOUT MAGAZINE BASIC ==

Create a truly unique design with Magazine Basic, a lightweight and fully responsive HTML5 theme based on the Gridiculous boilerplate. Use the Customizer to add your own background, page layout, site width and more. Distinguish each post with one of the eight supported post formats, such as: Video, Image, Aside, Status, Audio, Quote, Link and Gallery. Install JetPack to display each of your galleries through a tiled view and jQuery carousel. Compatible with bbPress & BuddyPress. Built using Bootstrap. Magazine Basic uses Google Fonts for improved typeface readability and works perfectly in desktop browsers, tablets and handheld devices. For a live demo go to http://demos.bavotasan.com/magazine-basic/.

== NOTES ==

* Top level (parent) menu items should not be clickable, but instead should just be a group heading with "#" in the URL field. That way they will work correctly on touch enabled devices.
